============

Author: Adam Suban-Loewen

A classic 2-D gravity orbiting game. Launch your ship from Earth and explore into space!

Designed in summer 2012, for the University of Toronto computer science portion of a science summer camp, for prospective high school students. Currently the game has 9 levels, with 24 astronomy info-bits. Levels can easily be created by editing levels.py according to the comments, and providing appropriate PNG files. The main game code is in engine.py, and constant game parameters can be changed in settings.py.
